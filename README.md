# Technical test 
#### All exercise is done, not time for test and bonus

### Ex 1: FizzBuzz in [main.py](https://github.com/LeoMbm/technical-test/blob/main/main.py)

- Write a function that outputs numbers from 1 to 100 inclusive.

- If the number is a multiple of 3, print 'Fizz' instead

- If the number is a multiple of 5, print 'Buzz' instead

- If the number is a multiple of 3 AND 5, print 'FizzBuzz' instead



- Bonus point: make your function accept a dict parameter containing multiple: word to output.


### Ex 2: Game of Life in [main.py](https://github.com/LeoMbm/technical-test/blob/main/main.py)

- Do you know the game of life ? You can find the rules here : https://playgameoflife.com (bottom left, Explanation, or if you need more precision, ask Google)

- Write a function that accepts a matrix in parameter and runs the Game of Life on it.

- Return the matrix after 5 iteration of the Game of Life.



- Bonus point: Just before returning the matrix, output it's result in HTML (don't need CSS, ugly stuff working is good)


### Ex 3: Hello, Nalios ! in [js/exo3.js](https://github.com/LeoMbm/technical-test/blob/main/js/exo3.js)

- In JavaScript, create a function that outputs "Hello, Nalios !"

- You can't use strings.


### Ex 4: PSQL in [exo4.sql](https://github.com/LeoMbm/technical-test/blob/main/exo4.sql)

- Write pseudo-SQL statements to create database tables to store the products of a basic webshop. Each product has a name, a price, a creation date and may belong to several categories. Categories have a name and a flag to indicate whether the category is private or public.

- Write a SQL query to find the list of products that belong to more than 5 public categories


### Ex 5: MySum in [main.py](https://github.com/LeoMbm/technical-test/blob/main/main.py)

- Write a function that takes an array of numbers in parameter (no joke : no None, no strings, only real numbers)

- Output the sum of these number, without using the sum() function.

- Bonus Point: Use recursion to get this sum
